1. The blockchain is a transparent, decentralized, and open place where many different things are stored. 
2. A smart contract is a program that interacts with the blockchain and enables users to interact with items on the blockchain. 
3. A transaction is when something on the blockchain is changed (purchased, transferred, etc.) and comes with a fee. A script is used to look at something on the blockchain and not change it.
